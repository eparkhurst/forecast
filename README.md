# Wipro Forecast

This is a basic 5 day forecast application that hits the openweathermap.org api
 and then returns 5 day weather forecast. The app was created using html,
 css and jQuery. The app may take a second or two while initially finding your
location but should be faster on subsequent refreshes seeing your location
 is stored in session storage

To run simply serve it up from the root directory

The deployed app is at https://wiproforecast.firebaseapp.com/
